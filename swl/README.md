# SWL: a Simple Wrapper Library

## Rationale

The same compiled routines may be available on different platforms but with
different argument types, size, values, etc.  This make the task of interfacing
these routines into high level languages a bit complex.  This library provide a
simple API which remain the same whatever the platform.
